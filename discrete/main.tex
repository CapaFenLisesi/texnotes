\part{Discrete Mathematics}

\initialletter{T}his is the part of this text which won't focus on numbers.
Were it not for specific examples, no numbers would exist in this part altogether.
This part sets the stage for the logical theory behind mathematics. We will start with \emph{propositional logic}, a very simple form of logic that establishes the groundwork for logic statements.
From there, we will describe \emph{predicate logic}, essentially a more powerful variant of propositional logic.
We will then analyze the idea of mathematical \emph{proofs}, eventually working our way toward \emph{set theory}, the groundwork of what most people know as mathematics.

You take the blue pill---the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill---you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.}
