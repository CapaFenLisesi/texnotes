\chapter{Predicates and Quantifiers}

Propositional logic is too simple for us to make many types of conclusions.
Instead, we use \textbf{predicate logic}, which allows us to make general
statements about objects and their properties.

A \textbf{propositional function}\index{propositonal function}, $P(x)$, is a
type of \textbf{predicate}\index{predicate} in
predicate logic. The important thing about propositional functions is that their
truth value depends on the value of a variable, $x$. A propositional function
becomes a proposition when a value is assigned to $x$.
\begin{ex}
  \[ P(n)=\text{``$n$ is prime''} \]
  Note that $P(n)$, here, where $P(n)$ is a propositional function with a truth value,
  is different from the numerical function $p(n)$. When we talk about functions in the
  context of propositional logic, we must be careful not to confuse them with their possible
  numerical counterparts.
\end{ex}

\section{Universal Quantification}
The \textbf{universal quantification}\index{universal quantification} of $P(x)$ is the statement
    ``$P(x)$ for all values of $x$ in the domain.''
  The notation \[\forall x P(x)\] denotes the universal quantification of $P(x)$.

If we wish to state that a given propositional function is true for all possible values in a domain, we use the \emph{universal quantification} of that function.

\section{Domain of Discourse}
Just as values for a variable must be stated in order for a propositional function to have a truth value, a \textbf{domain of discourse}\index{domain of discourse} must be specified in addition to the universal quantification.
This is often referred to as just the \emph{domain} of the function.

To show that the universal quantification of $P(x)$ is false for a domain, find
an $x$ for which $P(x)$ is false.

\section{Existential Quantification}\index{existential quantification}

If we wish to state that an element exists in a domain, we use the \emph{existential quantification} of a propositional function.

The \textbf{existential quantificaiton}\index{existential quantification} of $P(x)$ is the proposition
  ``There exists an element $x$ in the domain such that $P(x)$.''
We use the notation \[\exists x P(x)\] for the existential quantification of $P(x)$.

\begin{note}
  In order to show that the existential quantification of $P(x)$ is false, we must
  show that $P(x)$ is false for every possible value of $x$ in the domain.
\end{note}


\subsection{Uniqueness Quantifier}
A specific case of existential quantification is defined by the
\textbf{uniqueness quantifier}\index{uniqueness quantifier}, $\exists!$ or $\exists_1$. The notation
\[ \exists! x P(x) \]
is the statement ``There exists a unique $x$ such that $P(x)$ is true.'' The
downside to the uniqueness quantifier is that the rules of inference for
existential quantification cannot be used on it. Since propositional logic can
be used to express uniqueness already, we should try to avoid use of uniqueness
quantification.

To demonstrate uniqueness using propositional logic, we make a statement such as the following:
\[ \exists x \Big( P(x) \land \forall y \big( P(y) \implies (x=y)\big)\Big) \]

\section{Logical Equivalence of Quantified Propositions}\index{logical equivalence}

The following is a quote from Rosen's \emph{Discrete Mathematics and its Applications} on the issue:

\begin{quote}
  Statements involving predicates and quantifiers are \textbf{logically
  equivalent} if and only if they have the same truth value no matter what
  predicates are substituted into the statements and which the domain of
  discourse is used for the variables in these propositional functions. We use the
  notation $S \equiv T$ to indicate that two statements $S$ and $T$ involving
  predicates and quantifiers are logically equivalent.

The quantificaiton
\begin{equation}
  \exists y \forall x Q(x, y)
\end{equation}
denotes the propositon
\begin{quote}
  ``There is a real number $y$ such that for every real number $x$, $Q(x, y)$.''
\end{quote}

The quantificaiton
\begin{equation}
  \forall x \exists y Q(x, y)
\end{equation}
denotes the propositon
\begin{quote}
  ``For every real number $x$ there is a real number $y$ such that $Q(x, y)$.''
