The \emph{Fibonacci Sequence} is the first recursive number sequence known in Europe. Its first 10 numbers are

\[ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55\dots \quad \text{.} \]

A Fibonacci sequence, in general, is any sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceeding numbers.\cite{britannica12}


\subsection{History}

French mathematician Edouard Lucas coined the term ``Fibonacci sequence'' in the 19th century.
The sequence is found throughout nature, as in the spirals of sunflower heads, pine cones, snail shells, and animal horns.\cite{britannica12}
Because of this natural prevalence, patterns based on the Fibonacci sequence are considered aesthetically pleasing.
The sequence can be found in Mozart and Beethoven's works as well as in classical art and architecture. \cite[p.~94]{design10}


\subsection{Mathematics}

\begin{defn}The \emph{Fibonacci numbers} are the sequence of numbers \(\{F_n\}^\infty_{n=1}\) defined by the linear recurrence equation
\begin{equation}
  F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2} \text{.}
\end{equation}
Often, we will see them defined with \(F_0=0\).
\end{defn}

This can be represented in the \emph{closed form}
\begin{equation}
  F_n=\left[ \frac{\Phi^n}{\sqrt{5}}\right]
  \label{eq:nint}
\end{equation}
where \([x]\) is the \emph{nearest integer function}. \cite{mwfib}


\section{The Golden Ratio}

\end{figure}


The Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio are closely related.

\begin{defn}
  The \emph{golden ratio}, denoted \( \Phi \), is given by the positive solution to the equation
\begin{equation}
  \Phi^2 - \Phi - 1 = 0
\end{equation}
\end{defn}

Using the quadratic equation
(\ref{app:eq:quadratic})
we can find that
\begin{align*}
  \Phi =& \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1^2-4(1)(-1)}}{2} \\
  =& \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1+4}}{2} \\
  =& \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \\
  \intertext{and taking the positive root}
  \Phi =& \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \\
  =& 1.6180339887498948\dots
\end{align*}
\cite{mwgolden}

We will notice that many closed-form representations of the Fibonacci sequence use the golden ratio.
For example, \emph{Binet's Formula}
\begin{equation}
  F_n=\frac{\Phi^n-(-\Phi)^{-n}}{\sqrt{5}}
  \label{eq:binet}
\end{equation}
derived\footnote{Though not for the first time.} by Binet in 1843 and equation \ref{eq:nint} both write \(F_n\) in terms of \( \Phi \).\cite{mwbinet}

The ratio of consecutive terms in the Fibonacci sequence approximate the golden ratio:
\begin{align*}
  \frac{1}{1} &= 1 \\
  \frac{2}{1} &= 2 \\
  \frac{3}{2} &= 1.5 \\
  \frac{5}{3} &= 1.\overline{6}\dots \\
  \frac{8}{5} &= 1.6 \\
  \frac{13}{8} &= 1.625 \\
  \frac{21}{13} &\approx 1.6153846
\end{align*}
Through this, we can conclude that
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{F_n}{F_{n-1}}=\Phi
  \label{eq:limphi}
\end{equation}
\cite{mwfib}
