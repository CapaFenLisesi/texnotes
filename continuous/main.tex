\part{Mathematical Analysis}
\thispagestyle{empty}
\yinipar{\color{Maroon}H}ere we are going to study functions, series, sequences, and applications of these concepts.
The numbers we will find this section are almost always going to be \emph{real numbers},
which basically means they behave the way we expect numbers to behave and we are able to plot them on number lines, graph them, and all that fun stuff.

Most of this part is going to focus on what schools typically call ``calculus,''
and it covers the mathematics I have learned in my first three semesters as an undergraduate at Christopher Newport University.
